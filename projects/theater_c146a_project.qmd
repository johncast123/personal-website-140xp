title: "Designing an Interactive Olympic Experience for LA28"
subtitle: "Concept ideation, audience research, wish fulfillment & experience design" 
description: "Conducted a randomized block experiment to evaluate how different music genres impact short-term memory performance. Using a [software](https://islands.smp.uq.edu.au/login.php) which simulates islanders that we could perform experiments on, we compared no music, classical, and heavy metal conditions using ANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis. Results showed heavy metal significantly increased completion time. These materials were produced as part of the STATS 101B course at UCLA."
