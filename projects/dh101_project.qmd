description: "What causes the disparities in educational outcomes in the U.S.? Our team built *Roots of Education*, a research website examining systemic factors behind this inequity. Using the [U.S. education data set](https://edopportunity.org) from Stanford University, we cleaned and engineered data, created visualizations in Tableau, and synthesized secondard research across history, policy, and social inequality to figure out why these disparities persist."
