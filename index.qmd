# Hello! I'm John 👋

I'm a senior majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Economics at UCLA. I'm passionate about solving problems using data-driven insights and incentives to motivate change. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving problems with innovative yet simple solutions. I'm currently interested in product or project management roles, where I can empower diverse teams to build outcomes greater than the sum of their parts.

Outside of work, I love engaging with all forms of creative media 📸. In my free time you will find me watching a movie, reading a book, diving into a great game, editing a video, drawing or learning a new software. I also enjoy quality time with my family, playing golf, and running. I'm currently training for a marathon!

I'm a proud Singaporean 🇸🇬, and deeply grateful for the opportunities my family has given me. Their support has shaped my values and continues to motivate everything I pursue. 

Welcome to my website, feel free to reach out!
